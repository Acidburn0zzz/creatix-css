Creatix-CSS

The reset.css is as provided by Eric Meyer (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html). 
Some resets are by Groundwork-CSS (http://groundworkcss.github.io/).

The gridsystem and responsive behaviour are inspired by Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) and 
Groundwork-CSS (http://groundworkcss.github.io/). I find both frameworks great, but too bulky for my 
needs. So I pickt the features I liked and combined them in order to come up with a 
leaner version that gives me full responsiveness without loading to many files.

The css-only navigation is by Nick La, Toronto. The full tutorial can be found here:

The animate.css is a collection of pure CSS3 animations by Dan Eden (from https://daneden.me/animate/) .
